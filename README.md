## WEEK 1:

- We are introduced to the subject by the professor
- We were taught about lots of 'P's and 'Q's
- The subject was very confusing
- I was tought about **Logical Connectives**.

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator     | Shorthand | Formula                                       | Logical Expression            |
| :-------------: |:---------------------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| ¬               | Negation              | not       | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p)                          | ¬p                            |
| ∧               | Conjunction           | and       | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q))              | p ∧ q                         |
| v               | Disjunction           | or        | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q))              | p v q                         |
| ⊕               | Exclusive disjunction | xor       | if val(p) not equal val(q) = 1, otherwise 0   | p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q)  |
| →               | Conditional           | if, then  | if val(p) ≤ val(q) = 1, otherwise 0           | p → q ≡  ¬p v q               |
| ↔               | Biconditional         | iff       | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1, otherwise 0      | p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p)     |


## Week 2:

### LOGICAL EQUIVALENCES

 I learned about a new topic in DISMATH called **Logical Equivalences**.
 
|  **LAW**  |  **EQUIVALENCE**  |
| :------: | :-----------------------------: |
|  _Identity Laws_  |  p ∨ F ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ F ≡ T  |
|  _Domination Laws_  |  p ∨ T ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ F ≡ F  |
|  _Negation Laws_  |  p ∨ ¬p ≡ T  ;;  p ∧ ¬p ≡ F  |
|  _Double Negation Law_  |  ¬(¬p) ≡ p  |
|  _Idempotent Laws_  |  p ∨ p ≡ p  ;;  p ∧ p ≡ p  |
| _Distributive Laws_  |  p ∨ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ∨ q) ∧ (p ∨ r)  ;;  p ∧ (q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ q) ∨ (p ∧ r)  |
|  _Commutative Laws_  |  p ∨ q ≡ q ∨ p  ;;  p ∧ q ≡ q ∧ p  |
|  _Associative Laws_  |  (p ∨ q) ∨ r ≡ p ∨ (q ∨ r)  ;;  (p ∧ q) ∧ r ≡ p ∧ (q ∧ r)  |
|  _De Morgan's Laws_  |  ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q  ;;  ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q  |
|  _Absorption Laws_  |  p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p  ;;  p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p  |

- I also learned about **Propositional Logic** and **Quantifiers**. 
- Propositional Logic deals with proposition as a whole. (Subject + Predicate)
- Quantifiers indicates the generality of an open sentence in which a variable occurs.
- Quantifiers have two classifications, one being Existential Quantifiers (∃x) which means "There exist" and the other being Universal Quantifiers (∀x) which means "For all".
- I was tought how to use the implication equivalence "p → q ≡  ¬p v q" in evaluating

## Week 3:
- During this week, I was introduced to a topic called **Rules of Inference**.
- I was tought about arguments and to see if they are valid or a fallacy

### RULES OF INFERENCE TABLE   

|  **TYPE**  |  **RULE OF INFERENCE**  |  **TAUTOLOGY**  |
| -------: | :--------------: | :--------- |
|  _Modus Ponens_  |  p, p → q ∴ q  |  (p ∧ (p → q)) → q  |
|  _Modus Tollens_  |  ¬q, p → q ∴ ¬p |  (¬q ∧ (p → q)) → ¬p  |
|  _Hypothetical Syllogism_  |  p → q, q → r ∴ p → r  |  ((p → q) ∧ (q → r)) → (p → r)  |
|  _Disjunctive Syllogism_  |  p ∨ q, ¬p ∴ q  |  ((p ∨ q) ∧ ¬p) → q  |
|  _Addition_  |  p ∴ p ∨ q  |  p → p ∨ q  |
|  _Simplification_  |  p ∧ q ∴ p  |  (p ∧ q) → p  |
|  _Conjunction_  |  p, q ∴ p ∧ q  |  ((p) ∧ (q)) → (p ∧ q)  |
|  _Resolution_  |  p ∨ q, ¬p ∨ r ∴ q ∨ r  |  ((p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r)) → q ∨ r  |


## WEEK 4:

- Our professor discussed about the different **Methods of Proof**.

### Methods of Proof

|  **TYPE**  |  **Way to solve**  |
| -------: | :--------------: |
|  _Direct Proof_  |  1. Assume that p is true  |
|   |  2. Show that q is true (based on 1.)  |
|  _Proof by Contraposition_  |  1. Assume ¬q is true |
|    |  2. Show that ¬p is also true |
|  _Vacuous Proof_  |  Show that the p is false to make p → q true|
|  _Trivial proof_  |  Show that q is true, it follows that p → q is also true  |
|  _Proof by Contradiction_  |  1. Assume that the premise is not true |
|   |  2. Show that 1. will end up in a contradiction |
|  _Proof by Equivalence_  |  Prove that p → q and q → p is true using any of the previous methods of proof|
